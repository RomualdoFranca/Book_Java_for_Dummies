    /*204 PART 3 Working with the Big Picture: Object-Oriented Programming
        There are always interesting things for you to try:

        » A PlaceToLive has an address, a number of bedrooms, and an area (in
        square feet or square meters).

        Write the PlaceToLive class’s code.
        Write code for a separate class named DisplayThePlaces.

        Your DisplayThePlaces class creates a few PlaceToLive instances by assigning values to their
        address, numberOfBedrooms, and area fields.

        The DisplayThePlaces class also reads (from the keyboard) the cost of living in each place.

        For each place,your code displays the cost per square foot (or square meter) and the cost
        per bedroom.

        » Use your new PlaceToLive class and my DummiesFrame class (from
        Chapter 7) to create a GUI application. The GUI application takes information
        about a place to live and displays the place’s cost per square foot (or meter)
        and the cost per bedroom*/
